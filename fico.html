                    <p>The FICO Enterprise Security Score offers an easy-to-interpret metric that effectively measures cybersecurity risk exposure. The idea is to empower an organization to understand and strengthen its security posture, assess the network risk of vendors in its supply chain, and continuously monitor the long-term likelihood of a data breach. It leverages billions of data points from around the globe to deliver a transparent and predictive summary of enterprise cybersecurity assessment. There are 2 products in this suite: </p>

                 <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>As a UI/UX Summer Intern,</p>
                   <ul style="list-style:disc">
                        <li>I was an integral part of conducting customer and market research to understand customer behavior and translate them into product features.</li>
                        <li>I drafted personas and scenarios using Sketch to represent unique customer buckets and elucidate their goals, motivations, and pain-points.</li>
                        <li>I helped delineate a sitemap to ensure optimal navigation and information organization.</li>
                        <li>I created numerous iterations of sketches and interactive wireframes using Axure RP Pro and worked with stakeholders for approval.</li>
                       <li>I created high-fidelity mockups of several pages using Sketch and worked with the developers to ensure that the implementation was aligned with the design.</li>
                       <li>I designed screenshots for marketing material using Sketch.</li>
                       <li>I conducted usability tests over WebEx, and drafted all the artifacts for these.</li>
                       <li>I crafted a customer experience map leveraging the insights uncovered during the usability tests to highlight opportunities for enhancing the user experience.</li>
                    </ul>  
                
                <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding the users</h2>
                <hr/>
                    
                    <p>The planning phase mostly comprised of stakeholder interviews and meetings with the product manager to outline an overview of the product as well as delve into the finer nuances of customer and market research.</p>
                
                    <p>Once we had tangible research data, we identified four distinct customer buckets in organizations that would use this website. I created a persona and scenario for each customer bucket, focusing primarily on goals, motivations, and current pain-points. The emphasis during this phase was extensively on avoiding the elastic user and self-referential design. We derived key insights from this phase that helped transform customer requirements into corresponding features for launch and beyond. </p>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li><i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Chief Information Security Officers</li>

                </ul>  
            
                <h2 class="section-heading" style="margin-top:10%">Planning the design approach</h2>
                <hr/>
                
                <p>The entire application was broken down into specific features that were implemented in parallel work streams. The design phase for each feature was an iterative process of sketching, wireframing and prototyping while gaining consensus from the stakeholders and approval from the leadership. Once a design was finalized, it was handed over to the developers to implement. As we worked on the net feature in the pipeline, there was continual interaction with developers to ensure that the implementation aligned with the design. </p>
                
                <p>A fixed launch date made it imperative to strike the right balance between customer goals and business goals. The high-level design strategy was basically finding the sweet spot between creating striking visual representations that were intuitive for the user to comprehend, while maintaining the utility of the data and adhering to a comprehensive style guide that FICO had in place.  </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Designing the experience</h2>
                <hr/>
                
                    <p>The next step was to delineate the site navigation. To ensure and organized and easy-to-follow flow, we drew from the user experience map to plot logical touchpoints in a user’s journey while interacting with the website, and leveraged card-sorting to finalize the sitemap. </p>

                    <p>Once a basic outline of the website was in place, we started to dive into the design of individual pages. We initiated the design of Profile before Portrait, since it had more layers and elements that could be reused in Portrait. We followed an approach where we started designing from right to left of the sitemap, focusing on web pages at the granular level first, moving up towards the homepage. The first page we designed was the individual profile of any organization.</p>


                   <p>We kicked off by designing individual data elements and contextually strung them together to create pages. We wanted to ensure that the first element the user noticed would be the security score gauge, because we wanted the user to have an idea of the organization’s security posture right at the first glance on the profile. After a few iterations focusing on logical breakpoints that would divide the security score into categories depending on security risk, this was the final version:</p>
                
                    <img src="img/fico/gauge.png" class="img-responsive center-block" style="max-width:40%; height:auto"/>
                
                <p>The focus was on a visual representation that would provide an at-a-glance overview of the security risk of that profile. We identified key security statistics and elements that would be of importance to the user and created views that would be familiar to a user in the cyber-security domain as well as maintain the utility of the data. We iterated through several strategies in the form of sketches and wireframes, before securing the final design. </p>

                 <p>We then moved on to the portfolio page, the purpose of which was to logically group several profiles in a category, while providing a collated summary of the analytical security information of all these profiles. One of the critical elements was the distribution of security scores for all the profiles in that portfolio. We iterated through visual representations in the form of a donut chart, waffle chart, and line chart before settling on a bar chart, as it was the most optimized and least cluttered visual representation that was consistent through different applications. We also kept going back to customer requirements to decide which security elements should be displayed on the summary ribbon to strike the right balance between a minimalistic view yet highly useful data.</p>
                    
                <p>Next, we moved to the dashboard, which was an overview of all the portfolios that could be logically organized into profiles, represented in the form of tiles. We iterated through several sketches to determine the level of detail we wanted to display in each tile, with a focus on enough information to provide a quick summary of that portfolio, but not so much as to overload the user. After several discussions, we settled on providing a visual representation of the distribution of security scores for all the profiles within the portfolio and a list of top 3 profiles for that portfolio, arranged in descending order.</p>
                
                <p>We moved on to the landing page, that would offer an entry point into the different applications in this suite. Essentially, we had two layouts that emerged from a group brainstorm. Both had icons to represent and launch the products. The subtle difference lay in the fact that the first merely informed the user that the two products had advanced versions they hadn’t subscribed to (clean and minimal), while the second outlined an additional description of the features each of the advanced versions offered (text-heavy). We performed A/B testing with users and observed that the latter garnered a higher conversion rate. We noticed that detailing out advanced features that they were missing out on piqued their curiosity, as opposed to merely the knowledge of the existence of these versions. 
                </p>
                
                
                <p>There were several other tasks that I created user flows, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes for: 
                </p>
                
                  <ul style="list-style:disc">
                        <li>Setting up a new profile.</li>
                        <li>Filtering and sorting records on individual data pages. </li>
                        <li>A variety of administration tasks such as CRUD operation for users, configuring alerts and reports, setting up network prefixes and domains, and customizing integrations.</li>
                        <li>A variety of user tasks such as downloading CSV files, sending emails, and creating tickets.</li>
                      <li>Workflows for forgot password and two-factor authentication.</li>
                    </ul>  
                
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Usability testing</h2>
                <hr/>
                
                    <p>Once a stable version of the website was set up in the test environment, we decided to employ usability testing to understand how real users interacted with the website, and to identify potential usability issues. We initiated the process by identifying a four users in different organizations, sorted each user into a persona to understand their goals and motivations for using the system and draft a customized set of tasks for users belonging to a persona. We conducted online usability tests with these participants via WebEx. We also used the System Usability Scale to gauge the response of different users after interacting with the site. </p>
                 <p>The usability tests revealed that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-frown-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Customers found the onboarding process to be rather tedious and confusing, with the need for more explicit instructions. </li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-meh-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Customers felt that navigating to specific data pages was time-consuming due to the lack of intuitive names.</li>
                        <li> <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>Customers were excited about the new features introduced. </li>
                    </ul> 
                
                <h2 class="section-heading">Mapping the customer experience</h2>
                <hr/>
                
                    <p>With the qualitative and quantitative data collected from the tests, I plotted the empathic experience of the user's journey that manifested into an illustrative experience map. The focus was on capturing specific thoughts and emotions while the user interacted with key features, and highlighting opportunities for improving the user-experience.</p>
                
                <img src="img/fico/ux_map.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
                    
                <p>The usability tests were a catalyst that triggered the next version of the product, as we collected valuable pointers that we will subsequently implement to improve the user experience.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What did I learn?</h2>
                     <hr/>
                    
                    <ul style="list-style:disc">
                        <li>I reaped in significant exposure to the seemingly complex domain of cyber-security. I spent a lot of time interacting with stakeholders and customers in weeding out important information from heaps of cyber-security data, logically arranging data across webpages, and translating raw analytical data into intuitive visualizations, while still maintaining the utility of the data. </li>
                        <li>I learnt how to adhere to a comprehensive style guide while designing wireframes and prototypes, to ensure that ideas and concepts are translated into outcomes consistent with the FICO brand.</li>
                        <li>Since we were targeting a diverse range of technical and cyber-security knowledge in our customers, it was interesting to think about striking the right balance in information architecture and nomenclature. We wanted the UI to be intuitive enough for someone with little know-how, yet not appear to be over-simplifying things for a cyber-security-savvy customer. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
