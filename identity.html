							Our partners at the Jackson Interfaith Shelter, a 90-day temporary homeless shelter, approached us with a similar problem. They wanted to <span class="bold">streamline the process to get government-issued IDs</span>. Recently, the State of Michigan made changes to Section 8, a program designed to help residents secure more permanent housing, with the hopes of getting the chronically homeless into permanent homes faster. However, an unexpected issue was that eligible recipients had <span class="bold">insufficient time</span> to acquire all the documents necessary to redeem the Section 8 housing voucher.

                          It is built utilizing the principles of Kahneman to reduce cognitive load, and is essentially a survey that uses conditional logic to determine one detailed plan of action for a user to procure an ID.

									This was probably the most important part of the process, primarily due to the nature of our target users. These homeless people were already under trememdous emotional stress, with IDs being the least of their problems. The fact that the users were unable to articulate their problem with getting IDs was probably the biggest obstacle in the process.

										<li><i class="fa fa-star"></i> &nbsp; We had to resort to ethnographic research and subtle methods of need-finding, such as observing the homeless in their natural setting of the shelter, and gauging their goals and motivations, as shown below.</li>

									We determined that there were three main phases to get an ID: pre-application, applying, and in-process. The most critical phase was in pre-application. We narrowed the important IDS down to birth certificate, state ID, and social security ID. 
								</p>
								<p>
									We thought of two options. First, an <span class="bold">interactive infographic</span> that displayed the details of obtaining all the three forms of ID. However, typically, a user would not be missing ALL three forms. <span class="bold">Too much information</span> would confuse the user and render a poor user-experience. This led to the idea of a <span class="bold">survey based on conditional logic</span> that user would fill out. The answers would then bucket the user into a category based on which ID was the needed the most and easiest to obtain. The user would then be given personalized instructions on the steps of obtaining that ID. The primary motivation behind this idea was to <span class="bold">reduce the cognitive load</span> on an already stressed user.

									A significant challenge was that the target users (management and inhabitants of the Jackson Interfaith Shelter), were not tech-savvy. To address this, we stressed sustainability and usability over aesthetic appeal.  We decided to leverage the existing and ubiquitous platform of Google forms to run the survey and display the personalized information, as well as store the data.

									We tested out the prototypes with 12 target users at the Jackson Interfaith Shelter. 
								</p>
								<p>
									We had to be careful to avoid a situation of confirmation bias, as that would provide no helpful feednback for us as designers. We used the technique of actively probing them for criticism.
								</p>
								<p>
									The overall response was that the form was easy to read, understand and navigate. The instructions on the output were clear and helpful.
								</p>
								<p>In a nutshell,
									<ul>
										<li><i class="fa fa-star"></i> &nbsp;Residents preferred multiple questions with binary options, such as yes/no questions, rather than fewer complex questions. </li>
										<li><i class="fa fa-star"></i> &nbsp;Residents felt more comfortable with text, rather than other mediums like pictures, since they did not always know where to look in pictures for the right answer. </li>
										<li><i class="fa fa-star"></i> &nbsp;Finally, they preferred a touch screen device as they felt it was more natural than clicking.</li>

	                                It is helping residents get the basic identification (birth certificate, social security number, and a driver’s license/state ID) to get them started on their path to independent living.
